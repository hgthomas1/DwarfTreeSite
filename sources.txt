Apple:

Most apple trees are hardy to -25 degrees Fahrenheit, so there are very few places with “too many” chill hours. If you do live in one of those areas, move your apple tree to the garage or other cold but not too cold place. Remember that your tree needs below 45 degree temperatures for a certain period of time.
However, the roots need to stay above 15 degrees. This isn’t a problem for in-ground apples as the ground is often much warmer than the air. But the dirt in containers is closer to the temperature of the air, and you’ll need to insulate your pot or move it to a more sheltered location if your area is expecting temperatures below 15.

Apricot:

Apricot trees (Prunus armeniaca) grow well in containers and are a good choice for gardeners with big plans but limited space. Dwarf apricot varieties such as the ‘Stark Golden Glo” and “”Stella” work well in containers. Almost any apricot, however, can be grown as a dwarf if you are willing to prune it back and keep it small.

Cherry:
Modern cherries are self-fertile, so you only need one tree to ensure a good crop. If you can keep the birds off, that is; netting may be a necessary defense as the fruit ripens. Expect beautiful blossom and lots of fruit when the tree is established. Grow cherries as a bush on dwarfing rootstock or as a fan against a warm wall.

Fig:
If there’s a fruit tree that thrives in the cloistered environment of a container, it’s the fig tree!
Fig trees (Ficus carica) grow rampantly in the ground and spread their roots far and wide, often becoming invasive and destructive.
Not only does planting a fig tree in a container help to confine its roots, it also encourages greater fruit production!
This is reason enough to grow fig trees in a container, even more so if you have a small yard.

Lime:
Love the heavenly aroma of citrus blossoms but live in a less than ideal growing climate for citrus trees? Have no fear, potted lime trees are just the ticket. Growing lime trees in pots have the advantage of ease of movement.

Lemon:
You want to grow lemons but stop because you run out of space or you don’t grow it because you live in a colder region. If this is your plight then growing a lemon tree in a pot is a smart idea. Plant it on a patio, terrace or in indoors and you will be bestowed by its scented flowers and soft yellow citrus fruits.

Olive:
Don’t have a garden? You can still own a fruiting olive tree, grown in a container. A sunny balcony and the right climate are the essential things; that, and time.
Italians have grown fruit trees in containers for centuries, keeping them protected in special sheds during the winter.
Come spring, the trees are wheeled out to the sunshine again.

Orange:
Dwarf citrus trees are especially suited for container growing as they can be kept at manageable sizes. Container growing allows gardeners to overcome poor soil conditions or limited space in a landscape. People enjoy their trees in decorative pots on a patio or apartment balcony.
